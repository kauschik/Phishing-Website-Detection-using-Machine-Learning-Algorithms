# Phishing-Website-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-Algorithms


## Content
Data is containg 5,49,346 entries.

- There are two columns.

- Label column is prediction col which has 2 categories

  - A. Good - which means the URLs is not containing malicious stuff and this site is not a Phishing Site.

## Source 
This dataset is obtained from Kaggle

## Motivation 
I naturally gravitate toward projects of this nature because I am interested in cybersecurity.

Each student chose a topic that interests them personally when our data science course coordinator instructed us to produce a project utilising machine learning methods. 

So I started looking for tough assignments that were related to cybersecurity so that I could learn new things and subjects.

When I first learned about this phishing website detection, I made the decision to do this project in order to learn more about phishing websites and social engineering.
